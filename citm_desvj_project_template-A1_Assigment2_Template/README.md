# {Pikutara}

## Description

"Pikutara", (in Basque, "to hell"), is a medieval-style platform game where a knight has to close a portal to hell through which enemies have entered. Our idea is for the first level to be set in the forest to reach hell, and the second level to take place in hell itself, where the character must close the portal.
